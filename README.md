# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
## Project Description
This is a group project that deploys a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

This is the first step towards building the AirBnB clone. We shall be dealing with the console / command 
interpreter in this project.
## Command Interpreter
Using the console, we shall be able to;
* create a data model
* manage (create, update, destroy, ect) objects
* store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

We shall be manipulating a powerful storage engine which will give us abstraction between "My object" and "How they are stored and persisted". This abstraction will allow us to change the type of storage easily without updating all of our codebase. The console will be used to validate the storage engine.
